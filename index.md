<h3>Teachers Notes</h3>
<p>This website contains a variety of activities for children to do which will help to teach them some basic vocabulary. Each part should contain a small explanation which the children can refer back to if they get stuck or you can use to help go over the points of learning. The link below will take you to an online Spanish dictionary which they can use as well if really stuck. Most importantly, let them have fun with it! </p>
